## Data Analysis Plan

- How long does it take an animal to be adopted in California?
- Is there a relationship between animal colour and length of time to adopt?
- What proportion of animals arrive in an injured or ill condition?

```{r}
# analyse intake condition
intake_condition <- longbeach %>%
  count(longbeach$intake_condition, name = "Frequency") %>%
  filter(Frequency < 300) %>%
  arrange(-Frequency)
intake_condition
```

```{r}
group <- c("group-1","group-2","group-3")
value <- c(13,5,22)
data1 <- data.frame(group,value)

ggplot(intake_condition, aes(fill=`longbeach$intake_condition`, values=Frequency)) +
  geom_waffle() +
  theme_void()
```
